the simulation after initialization procedure is complete; arguments:
   * gui - run also Gazebo client
   * headless - run Gazebo without graphic card support (all rendering is disabled, even for visual sensors)
   * verbose
   * debug - if `true`, the deployer is executed in gdb.
   * world_name - world file name with respect to GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH
   * load_robot_description - if `true`, the launch file loads robot description from urdf and runs robot_state_publisher
   * GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH - please refer to Gazebo documentation
   * GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH - please refer to Gazebo documentation
   * use_kinect - `true` or `false`: enable or disable kinect simulation
   * ORO_LOGLEVEL - orocos log level, the higher number the more verbose output
